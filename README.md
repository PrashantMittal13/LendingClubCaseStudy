## General Information
- Understand and analyse the data to identify the driving factors behind loan default so that the company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk management.
- The analysis should help the company recognize a potential defaulter and then avoid/refuse lending loans to that person, hence reducing the risky loan approvals.

## Conclusions
- It is highly risky to lend loans to applicants in the 0-20K annual income range.
- As the interest rates increases, the chances of charge off increases, hence the company should formulate more loan plans with lesser interest rates.
- Small Business Purpose loan lenders show high tendency for defaulting.
